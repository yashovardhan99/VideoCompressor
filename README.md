# VideoCompressor
A simple video compressor using Kotlin and FFMpeg

## Using the app
Download the app from [releases](github.com/yashovardhan99/VideoCompressor/releases/) and install it on your phone.

Launch the app and select any video to continue. You will see an option to enter a bitrate, enter the desired rate and press compress. This may take some time depending on the video size.

Once compressed, you can watch the video on the next page. The video will be saved to an internal app folder.

## Libraries used
Apart from standard android architecture libraries, I have used:-
- [FFMpeg](https://tanersener.github.io/mobile-ffmpeg/) for compression
- [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) for logging
